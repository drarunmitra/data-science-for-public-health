-   Spark interest rather than teaching


## What is Public Health?

::: {.columns}

<br>

::: {.column width="40%"}
* Public health is the science and practice of protecting and improving the health of a population.

* Core functions include disease prevention, health promotion, and surveillance.

<br>

::: {.callout-note}
### Public Health 

Public Health is multi-faceted and interdisciplinary, involving experts from various fields, including epidemiology, biostatistics, health services research, and behavioral sciences, to address the complex determinants of health.

## Why is Public Health Important?

### Public Health vs. Clinical Medicine

- Prevents disease, prolongs life, promotes health through organized efforts.
- Focuses on population-level health issues, preventive measures rather than curative.
- Public health prioritizes common good over individual interests.
- It promotes structural actions for disease prevention in society.

### To measure health & disease status accurately and economically in poor countries



- **GC 13:** Develop technologies that permit quantitative assessment of population
health status.
- **GC 14:** Develop technologies that allow assessment of individuals for multiple
conditions or pathogens at point-of-care.

## What is Spatial Data Science?

::: columns

::: {.column width="70%"}


::: {.callout-note }

## Definition

<br>

### Spatial data science (SDS) is a subset of Data Science that focuses on the unique characteristics of spatial data,  <span style="color:red;">moving beyond</span>  simply looking at <span style="color:red;">where</span> things happen <span style="color:red;">to understand why</span> they happen there.

> CARTO  - [https://carto.com/what-is-spatial-data-science](https://carto.com/what-is-spatial-data-science)
:::


:::

::: {.column width="30%"}
![](images/what-is-sds.png)
:::

:::


Like data science, spatial data science seems to be a field that <span style="color:red;">arises bottom-up</span> in and <span style="color:red;">from many existing scientific disciplines</span> and industrial activities <span style="color:red;">concerned with application of spatial data</span>, rather than being a sub-discipline of an existing scientific discipline.

- Wealth of Spatial Data

- 70% of all data that is generated data has spatial attributes

- Routine health data can be geo-referenced

- Provide a gateway for researchers and practitioners to examine the role and harness the power of SDS in public health

- Coupled with the emerging field of spatial statistics, the analysis of this location-based data is developing new and novel directions for public health.

## Core Concepts related to GIS

Spatial data are fundamental to many geographical analyses and spatial data science draws strongly from key geographical concepts

<br>

### First Law of Geography

::: columns
::: {.column width="70%"}

::: {.callout-note }

## Tobler's First Law 

*"Everything is related to everything else, but near things are more related than distant things"*

## Spatial Dependence and Complete Spatial Randomness
<br>

Spatial dependence is *"the propensity for nearby locations to influence each other and to possess similar attributes"*.

::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}
![](images/point_patterns.png){width="900"}
::: 


::: {.column width="40%"}

This means natural phenomenon are not spatially distributed at random.

- temparature, 
- rainfall, 
- population density, 
- socio-economic conditions etc.

It can be measured by the indices of Spatial Autocorrelation.


## Spatial Autocorrelation


Refers to the presence of systematic spatial variation in a mapped variable.

The terms **spatial association** and **spatial dependence** are often used to reflect spatial auto-
correlation as well.

## Core Concepts related to GIS


### Map Projections & coordinate reference system (CRS)

::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}

- Map projections try to transform the earth from its spherical shape (3D) to a planar shape (2D).

- A CRS then defines how the two-dimensional, projected map in your GIS relates to real places on the earth. 

- The decision of which depends on the extent of the area, analysis type, and often on the availability of data.
